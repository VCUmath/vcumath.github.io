<h4>VCU Undergraduate Math major:</h4>

<ul>
<li> Our undergraduate program includes a number of discrete mathematics courses including Introduction to Graph Theory, Introduction of Combinatorics, and Experimental Mathematics. A listing of all VCU Math courses, with descriptions can be found <a href="https://math.vcu.edu/programs/undergraduate/courses/">here</a>.
<li> For information about VCU's undergraduate math program, including how to apply, see: <a href="https://math.vcu.edu/programs/undergraduate/degree-programs/bachelor-of-science/">VCU Math Bachelor-of-science degree program</a>
</ul>



<a name = "plus">
<h4>VCU Undergraduate Math major and Accelerated Masters "4+1":</h4>

<ul>
<li> It is possible to get a M.S. in addition to a B.S. in mathematics in <a href="https://math.vcu.edu/programs/undergraduate/degree-programs/accelerated-bs-and-ms/">a single extra year</a>.
</ul>

<a name = "masters">
<h4>VCU Math Master's degree:</h4>

<ul>
<li> VCU's graduate mathematics programs includes a 3-course sequence in Graph Theory, as well as a 3-course sequence in Combinatorics. We also offer courses in both theoretical as well as applied linear algebra, and several courses on algebra.
	<li> For information about VCU's math Master's degree program, including how to apply, see: <a href= "https://math.vcu.edu/programs/graduate/degree-programs/master-of-science/">VCU Math M.S. program</a>.
</ul>

<a name = "phd">
<h4>VCU Discrete Math PhD:</h4>

<ul>
<li> Our Ph.D. program (<a href="https://sysm.vcu.edu">Systems Modeling and Analysis</a>) is joint with VCU's department of Statistics and Operations Research, and offers concentrations in any of Discrete Mathematics, Mathematical Biology, Operations Research, or Statistics.
	<li>Coursework for a student concentratiing in discrete mathematics will include all of the discrete courses mentioned above, together with research with one of our dicrete mathematics research faculty.
