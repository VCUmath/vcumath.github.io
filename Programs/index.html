VCU has an <a href="#undergrad">undergraduate math major</a> (B.S), a <a href="#masters">Master's degree</a> (M.S), an  a <a href="#plus">accelerated bachelor and master's degree</a> (4+1) and a <a href="#phd">Doctor of Philosophy</a> (Ph.D.), all with possibilities for significant discrete mathematics content, research, and advising.

<a name = "undergrad">
<h4>VCU Undergraduate Math major:</h4>

<ul>
<li> Our undergraduate program includes a number of discrete mathematics courses including Introduction to Graph Theory, Introduction of Combinatorics, and Experimental Mathematics. A listing of all VCU Math courses, with descriptions can be found <a href="https://math.vcu.edu/programs/undergraduate/courses/">here</a>.
<li> For information about VCU's undergraduate math program, including how to apply, see: <a href="https://math.vcu.edu/programs/undergraduate/degree-programs/bachelor-of-science/">VCU Math Bachelor-of-science degree program</a>
	<li> Please contact <a href="mailto:math@vcu.edu">math@vcu.edu</a> for general information about Undergraduate Mathematics study at VCU. For discrete mathematics questions, contact <a href="mailto:clarson@vcu.edu">Craig Larson</a>.
</ul>



<a name = "plus">
<h4>VCU Undergraduate Math major and Accelerated Masters "4+1":</h4>

<ul>
<li> It is possible to get a M.S. in addition to a B.S. in mathematics in <a href="https://math.vcu.edu/programs/undergraduate/degree-programs/accelerated-bs-and-ms/">a single extra year</a>.
<li> Please contact <a href="mailto:mathgrad@vcu.edu">mathgrad@vcu.edu</a> for general information about the "4+1" math program at VCU. For discrete mathematics questions, contact <a href="mailto:clarson@vcu.edu">Craig Larson</a>.
</ul>

<a name = "masters">
<h4>VCU Math Master's degree:</h4>

<ul>
<li> VCU's graduate mathematics programs includes a 3-course sequence in Graph Theory, as well as a 3-course sequence in Combinatorics. We also offer courses in both theoretical as well as applied linear algebra, and several courses on algebra.
	<li> For information about VCU's math Master's degree program, including how to apply, see: <a href= "https://math.vcu.edu/programs/graduate/degree-programs/master-of-science/">VCU Math M.S. program</a>.
